/**
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers,N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to
 * insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j
 * through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is,if M= 10011, you can assume that there are
 * at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j-3 and i=2, because M could
 * not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *
 * Input:N=16000000000, M=10011, i =2, j =6 Output: N = 10001001100
