 * Given a sorted array full of integers, can you write a method to return a BST?

 * A binary search tree (BST), sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a
 * node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a comparable key (and an associated
 * value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all
 * nodes in that node's left sub-tree are smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right
 * sub-tree. Each node has no more than two child nodes.
