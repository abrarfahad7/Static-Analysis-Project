  /**
   * Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(N^2)
   * time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the
   * similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance
   * advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where
   * auxiliary memory is limited.
   *
   * The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted,
   * which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items
   * remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is
   * empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the
   * smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging
   * it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist
   * boundaries one element to the right.
