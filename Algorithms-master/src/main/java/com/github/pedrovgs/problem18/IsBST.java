/**
 * Given a binary tree passed as argument, can you write a method to return true if the binary tree
 * is a Binary Search Tree?
 *
 * A Binary Search Tree (BST), sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a
 * node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a comparable key (and an associated
 * value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all
 * nodes in that node's left sub-tree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right
 * sub-tree. Each node has no more than two child nodes. Each child must either be a leaf node or
 * the root of another binary search tree. The left sub-tree contains only nodes with keys less
 * than
 * the parent node; the right sub-tree contains only nodes with keys greater than the parent node.
 * BSTs are also dynamic data structures, and the size of a BST is only limited by the amount of
 * free memory in the operating system. The main advantage of binary search trees is that it
 * remains
 * ordered, which provides quicker search times than many other data structures.
