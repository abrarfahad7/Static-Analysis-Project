 *
 * Input: 63 = 111111
 * Output: 0
 *
 * Input = 5 = 101
 * Output = 2 = 010

   * number and at the end we are going to remove the first one we added to take into account the
   * number of digits of this binary number. The complexity order of this algorithm in space terms
   * is O(1) and in time terms is equals to O(N) where N is the number of digits in the binary
