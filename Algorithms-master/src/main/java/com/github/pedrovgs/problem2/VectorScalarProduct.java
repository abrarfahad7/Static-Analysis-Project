/**
 * Identify which is the most convenient data structure to implement a Vector of integers and code
 * it.
 *
 * Once you have that Vector class ready implement the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar
 * product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually
 * coordinate vectors) and returns a single number. This operation can be defined either
 * algebraically or geometrically. Algebraically, it is the sum of the products of the
 * corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers. For example
 *
 * [1,2,3] * [1,3,2] = 1*1 + 2*3 + 3*2 = 7
 * [1,1] * [2,10] = 12

  /**
   * To resolve this problem we are going to take into account two main requirements: vectors can't
   * be null and the number of elements for vector have to be the same. Once we have added this
   * guards throwing execptions we are going to implement this algorithm.
   *
   * To implement this scalar product we are going to iterate over v1 and v2 at the same time using
   * a pointer defined with an integer named "i". For every iteration we are going to accumulate
   * the product of elements at position "i" for v1 and v2 inside an auxiliary variable named
   * result.
   *
   * The complexity order of this algorithm in time terms is O(N) where N is the number of elements
   * per vector. In space terms, the complexity order of this algorithm is O(1) because the
   * auxiliary data structures used to implement this algorithm are not related to any problem
   * parameter.
