 * Class created to represent a Vector of integers. This class uses an array as main data structure
 * because the number of elements inside a vector can't change and we can provide constant
 * complexity order O(1) to access random elements inside the array.
 *
 * For simplicity, we are going to assume that the only type of elements we are going to use is
 * int. We could change this implementation to use generics and accept different types if needed.
